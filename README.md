# Settings-visionOS
A **work-in-progress** SwiftUI recreation of the visionOS Settings app.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is focused on the latest public releases of visionOS and Xcode. Use an older branch for older versions.

## Information
- Recreation of Apple's Settings app for visionOS 26.1 (23N49).
- All features within the app are only simulations and have no effect on outside of the app.
- This is based off of the Simulator and not a physical Apple Vision Pro for now.
- Previous versions are available as their own branches, going as far back as 1.0. Less features are available in earlier versions.

> [!CAUTION]
> Some of the code in this project may rely on private APIs. It is strictly for demonstration purposes only.
>
> **Do not reuse any code from this project that relies on private methods.** Consider publicly supported alternatives instead.

# Settings-visionOS
SwiftUI recreation of the visionOS Settings app.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project is currently focused on visionOS 26 beta using Xcode 26 beta. Use an older branch to deploy this project on visionOS 2.5/Xcode 16.4 or earlier.

## Information
- This project is a recreation of Apple's current and default Settings app for Apple Vision Pro **(Simulator)** on visionOS 26 **beta 5** (23M5311g).
- The `main` branch will have the latest available version of visionOS; older versions are available as their own branch.
- All features within the app are only simulations and have no effect on outside of the app.
- Since this project is based off of the Simulator and not a physical Apple Vision Pro, aspects such as simulated controls and views only on physical devices are not implemented at this time.

## Examples

## Usage
Open the project in Xcode and run with either a Simulator running visionOS or a physical Apple Vision Pro with Developer Mode enabled as a destination.

Feel free to fork, explore, and make the project your own for any personal use!

## Disclaimers
- This app is a recreation of one of Apple's own apps and its designs.
- All assets such as icons and images are not my own in any way.

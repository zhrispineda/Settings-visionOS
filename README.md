#  Settings-visionOS
SwiftUI recreation of the visionOS Settings app.

## Information
- This personal project is a recreation of Apple's current and default Settings app for Apple Vision Pro **(Simulator)** on visionOS 1.0 (21N305).
- All features within the app are only simulations and have no effect on the device outside of the app.
- Most views are complete, but lack features such as saving data, including basic variables, perhaps for now.
- Since this is based off of the Simulator and not a physical Apple Vision Pro, aspects such as simulated controls for radios, are missing in areas such as the top of the sidebar below the Sign In button.
- Currently, this project does not use any Swift Packages, UIKit, Storyboards, or Objective-C.

## Usage
Open the project in Xcode and run with either a Simulator running Apple Vision Pro's visionOS or a physical Apple Vision Pro with Developer Mode enabled as a destination.

As this is a personal project for learning Swift and SwiftUI, feel free to fork, explore, and make the project your own for any personal purpose!

## Contributing
Contributions such as pull requests that help make the app more accurate and better optimized are always welcome.

## Disclaimers
- This app is a recreation of one of Apple's own apps and its designs.
- All assets such as icons including those of Apple's and the Bluetooth symbol are not my own in any way.
- This personal project started on January 2, 2024. Feel free to look through the commit history to see the project evolve from a single view to its current state.

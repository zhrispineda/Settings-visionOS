## Information
- This personal project is a recreation of Apple's current and default Settings app for Apple Vision Pro **(Simulator)** on visionOS 1.2 (21O589).
- The `main` branch will have the latest available version of visionOS; older versions will be available as their own branch.
- All features within the app are only simulations and have no effect on the device outside of the app.
- Most views are complete, but lack features such as saving/retrieving data for now.
- Since this project is based off of the Simulator and not a physical Apple Vision Pro, aspects such as simulated controls and views only on physical devices are not implemented.
- This project does not use of Swift Packages, UIKit, Storyboards, or Objective-C; it is pure Swift & SwiftUI.

## Usage
Open the project in Xcode and run with either a Simulator running Apple Vision Pro's visionOS or a physical Apple Vision Pro with Developer Mode enabled as a destination.

As this is a personal project for learning Swift and SwiftUI, feel free to fork, explore, and make the project your own for any personal purpose!

## Disclaimers
- This app is a recreation of one of Apple's own apps and its designs.
- All assets such as icons and images are not my own in any way.
- Feel free to look through the commit history to see the project evolve from a single view to its current state.
